# C++ Physics Engine 🧱🕹️

![physics engine image](physics_image.png)

A **modular, extensible 2D platformer engine** built entirely in C++.
This project serves as a sandbox for building physics-based games with editable levels, real-time simulation, and full source access — like a lightweight, code-first Unity.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔧 Custom 2D physics engine (rigid bodies, gravity, drag, friction)
- 🧩 Fully object-oriented and modular architecture
- 🎮 Real-time platformer mechanics: movement, enemies, lava, powerups
- 🖼️ SFML GUI for visualizing physics in motion
- 🗺️ Editable levels + sprites via external folders
- 🛠️ Designed for extension, experimentation, and teaching

---

## 🛠️ Designed For:

- ✅ Game development education
- ✅ Physics or math simulation
- ✅ C++ learning
- ✅ Custom level design & engine hacking
